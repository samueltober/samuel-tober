:   **Msc, Computer Science**; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm
* GPA: 4.7/5

2017-2020
:   **BSc, Engineering Physics**; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm

Experience
----------

**Gjensidige Forsikring**

Gjensidige is a leading Nordic insurance group listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

* Developed a machine learning based pricing model that on average was 20% better at predicting the risk of a
customer compared to the current model employed by Gjensidige

* Currently working on a binary classifier to predict whether an existing customer is likely to buy new insurance
products to boost additional sales

* Built web scraping applications to collect large amounts of data to aid the CRM team

* Create reports using SQL/SAS on a monthly basis, and communicate results across different departments of
Gjensidige

**Formula Student**

One of the largest engineering competitions in the world, where university teams design, build and compete with
small scale race cars.

* Developed and implemented path planning algorithms for the driverless system of the car

*  Worked together with 10+ other members in a startup-like environment

*  Collaborated with academic experts in the field to ensure our line of attack was feasible

*  Qualified to the most reputable race at Hockenheimring in Germany

Projects
--------------------

**Tree-based Machine Learning for Insurance Pricing**

As part of my bachelor thesis at Gjensidige I developed, tested and compared tree-based machine learning models
on Gjensidige’s home insurance data set

* Performed feature engineering and cleaning of large amounts of data
* Had to deal with very unbalanced data when training the models
* Evaluated the models’ predictive performance, as well as potential profitability

**Developing a Camera-based Method for Measuring Blood Pressure**
Researched the possibility of using a video camera and image processing in Matlab to measure blood pressure non-invasively. The project was carried out at KTH School of Technology and Health.

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
