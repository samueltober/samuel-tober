Experience
----------

**Gjensidige Forsikring:**

Gjensidige is a leading Nordic insurance group listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

* Developed a machine learning based pricing model that on average was 20% better at predicting the risk of a
customer compared to the current model employed by Gjensidige

* Currently working on a binary classifier to predict whether an existing customer is likely to buy new insurance
products to boost additional sales

* Built web scraping applications to collect large amounts of data to aid the CRM team

* Create reports using SQL/SAS on a monthly basis, and communicate results across different departments of
Gjensidige

**Formula Student**

One of the largest engineering competitions in the world, where university teams design, build and compete with
small scale race cars.

* Developed and implemented path planning algorithms for the driverless system of the car

*  Worked together with 10+ other members in a startup-like environment

*  Collaborated with academic experts in the field to ensure our line of attack was feasible

*  Qualified to the most reputable race at Hockenheimring in Germany

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
