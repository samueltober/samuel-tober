:   **Msc, Computer Science**; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm
* GPA: 4.7/5

2017-2020
:   **BSc, Engineering Physics**; KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm

Experience
----------

**Gjensidige Forsikring**

Gjensidige is a leading Nordic insurance group listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

* Developed a machine learning based pricing model that on average was 20% better at predicting the risk of a
customer compared to the current model employed by Gjensidige

* Currently working on a binary classifier to predict whether an existing customer is likely to buy new insurance
products to boost additional sales

* Built web scraping applications to collect large amounts of data to aid the CRM team

* Create reports using SQL/SAS on a monthly basis, and communicate results across different departments of
Gjensidige

**Formula Student**

One of the largest engineering competitions in the world, where university teams design, build and compete with
small scale race cars.

* Developed and implemented path planning algorithms for the driverless system of the car

*  Worked together with 10+ other members in a startup-like environment

*  Collaborated with academic experts in the field to ensure our line of attack was feasible

*  Qualified to the most reputable race at Hockenheimring in Germany

Projects
--------------------

**Tree-based Machine Learning for Insurance Pricing**

As part of my bachelor thesis at Gjensidige I developed, tested and compared tree-based machine learning models
on Gjensidige’s home insurance data set

* Performed feature engineering and cleaning of large amounts of data
* Had to deal with very unbalanced data when training the models
* Evaluated the models’ predictive performance, as well as potential profitability

**Developing a Camera-based Method for Measuring Blood Pressure**

Researched the possibility of using a video camera and image processing in Matlab to measure blood pressure non-invasively. The project was carried out at KTH School of Technology and Health.

Programming Languages

:   **Python:** I have worked extensively with Python both professionally and in academic contexts. I have experience using Python for data science through Numpy, Pandas, sklearn and seaborn, but also for larger software projects. 

:   **SQL/SAS:** SQL and SAS is something I use almost everyday in my work at Gjensidige for querying from our large data tables. I am confident with writing complex queries and used to generate reports through SQL and SAS.

: **R:** R is another language I have used a lot in my work, I have built machine learning models, performed analysis of large sets of data and developed libraries of functions, among other things. 

: I also have knowledge of **C** and **Java** through course work
