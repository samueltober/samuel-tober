Recently I have been working on time series modelling for demand prediction, a very useful but indeed difficult task. After doing some research on the topic, and experimenting with different models, I stumbled upon the out-of-box model Prophet, developed and maintained by Facebook. Motivated by its ease of use, and impressive performance, I decided to give it a try. This article will be focused on how Prophet works, why it is such an appealing model, and how you can get started with Prophet on your own time series problems.
