title: About
---

My name is Samuel Tober, and I am a Msc. student in computer science at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. For a living, I work as a data analyst within insurance, mainly focusing on risk premium modelling, machine learning and data engineering. I am passionate about data science, mathematics, and technology in general. I spend most of my spare time climbing and playing the piano (not at the same time though!). I use this website to document my projects, as a set of tutorials on various subjects that I find interesting, and as my personal journal. My goal is to not always write about technology related matters, but also to touch on other topics. I hope you find something of value!
